<h1>Java Homework</h1>

<p><strong>AdditionalApiController.java</strong> — Lab 2</p>
<p><strong>ApiController.java</strong> — Lab 3</p>

<p>As requested, I completed Lab 3 first, followed by Lab 2, since the second lab is more challenging.</p>

<p>I added comments explaining the purpose of each part of the code.</p>

<p>All files are located at:</p>
<pre><code>lab3/src/main/java/com/example/lab3</code></pre>
